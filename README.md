## Overview
City Hospital, a reputable institution within its community, traditionally relies on intuition and historical trends for financial and operational decisions. However, this approach has led to inefficiencies and missed opportunities, largely due to a lack of a centralized view of financial data. The hospital’s leadership wants to adopt a data-driven approach to gain a clearer understanding of financial performance, optimize resource allocation, and improve decision-making, hence this project.

## Problem Statement
City Hospital lacked a centralized view of their financial performance. This made it difficult to identify trends, optimize resource allocation, and make data-driven decisions.

## Business Analyst Role
As a Business Analyst, the goal is to help City Hospital consolidate its financial and operational data, identify key trends, and create a framework for data-driven decision-making. This requires establishing methods for tracking financial metrics, centralizing data access, and setting up reporting tools-insightful dashboards using Excel that enable the leadership team to make timely and informed decisions.

## Actions Taken and Tools Used to Create Insightful Dashboards
Based on an analysis of City Hospital’s needs, here are actionable steps we took to improve data-driven financial and operational decisions:
## 1. Centralize Financial and Operational Data
- Establish a centralized data repository to unify all financial and operational data, making it accessible to authorized users in real time. This might include information on costs, revenues, patient throughput, staffing, and resource usage.
- Integrate data from various departments (billing, procurement, staffing) into this centralized system, ensuring data consistency and accuracy for cross-functional analysis.
## 2. Implement Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- Identify relevant KPIs that impact finances and operations, such as cost per patient, resource utilization rates, labor costs, and patient wait times.
- Set benchmarks and goals based on historical data and industry standards, allowing the leadership to assess current performance and identify areas for improvement.
## 3. Develop Advanced Analytics and Reporting Dashboards
Create automated dashboards that display real-time financial and operational metrics, allowing hospital leaders to quickly identify trends, cost inefficiencies, and opportunities for optimization.
## Dashbaord 1 Using Key Performance Indicators
- Calculate the total revenue, expenses and profit cumulated by the hospital over time.
- What is the profit margin generated by the hospital?
- How many Doctors and Patients does the hospital have on record?
- What is the trend of revenue generation over the given time period?
- Which Specialties yielded the highest and the lowest revenue ?
- How much revenue those each procedure category make in this hospital?
- Looking at each procedure in the hospital, what is the total revenue, expenses and profit margin and in how many transactions was this achieved?
## Dasboard 2 - Tailored Analysis
- Who are the top revenue generating doctor in the hospital?
- Who are the top 5 patients that impacted on Revenue generation?
- How many doctors are in each specialty and how many patients patronize each of these specialties?
- What is the trend of patients visits to the hospital over time?
- By gender description give a the total no. of Doctors and patients inthe hospital.

## 4. Establish a Data-Driven Decision-Making Culture
- Train hospital leadership and staff on using analytics tools, interpreting data, and incorporating insights into daily decision-making processes.
- Regularly review and update data-driven strategies to adapt to changes in hospital operations, regulatory requirements, or community health needs.

## Result/Outcome
By implementing these actions, City Hospital can expect to see:
- Improved financial oversight, with the ability to quickly identify cost-saving opportunities and make informed budget allocations.
- Optimized resource allocation, reducing wastage, improving staff scheduling, and ensuring essential resources are available when needed.
- Enhanced decision-making processes, with hospital leadership relying on real-time data and predictive insights, which minimizes reliance on intuition and maximizes efficiency.
- Increased transparency and accountability across departments, as data-backed KPIs facilitate performance tracking and continuous improvement.

## Conclusion
This insighful analysis helped City Hospital to achieve a more streamlined, efficient, and financially sound operation, ultimately supporting better patient care and strengthening its reputation as a well-managed institution.
