  ## Overview
City Hospital, a reputable institution within its community, traditionally relies on intuition and historical trends for financial and operational decisions. However, this approach has led to inefficiencies and missed opportunities, largely due to a lack of a centralized view of financial data. The hospitalâ€™s leadership wants to adopt a data-driven approach to gain a clearer understanding of financial performance, optimize resource allocation, and improve decision-making, hence this project.

## Problem Statement
City Hospital lacked a centralized view of their financial performance. This made it difficult to identify trends, optimize resource allocation, and make data-driven decisions.
